# Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree (drlnd)

Repository for project hand-ins in the Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotics nano-degree at [ND893 at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)

This repo consists of the following projects:

## [Project 1: Navigation](/project_1_Navigation)
Leverage neural networks to train an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.
